<p>Confident that the house is safe, you saunter swiftly through the front door, intent on getting to the TTY machine as quickly as possible. The living room is dark and empty, and it remains empty after you switch on the light. Your bedroom is up the stairs, which are to your immediate left. But you never make it up the staircase. The moment you turn for the stairs, you feel the cold blade of a knife sliding into your back. All you feel in the final moments is the <span style="color: #ff0000">burning</span> pain. </p>
