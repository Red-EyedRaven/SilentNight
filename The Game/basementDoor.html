<p> You open the door to the basement; the descending stairs lay before you and beyond is the dark, treacherous depths. But, as you look at the black, gaping maw of your basement, you hesitate; thoughts of knives in the dark, waiting to make their way into your back as you stumbled for the basement light switch dampens your will to explore. What if the intruder really was in the basement? What were you planning on doing if you did see him? Was your plan to get stabbed? You contemplate whether going down would be worth it. Do you want to proceed down, or retreat and go up the stairs as usually planned?
