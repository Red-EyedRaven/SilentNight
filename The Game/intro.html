<p>You're coming home from work as a professional cat video maker. You are deaf.
You discover your window smashed in. Someone broke into your house. It is a serial killer.
You go inside the house so you can contact the police with your teleprinter. 
However, the intruder is still there and you donâ€™t know that.
You can enter from the back or the front.
