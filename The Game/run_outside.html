<p>You run outside into the cool night air, desperate to get away. You dash across your yard. Maybe you could get some help from your neighbor across the street. What was her name? Sally? Molly? Polly? Mendeleev? It doesnâ€™t matter right now. While trying to remember the name, you run across the road, not looking both ways like your parents had instructed. You never notice the red 2008 Hyundai Elantra until it smashes into you
</p>
<p>
You get sent flying, and your neck gets snapped. You died by not following parental advice.
