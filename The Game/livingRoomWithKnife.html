<p> Now armed with more than just confidence and your fists, you step into the living room. To perhaps your bewilderment, or perhaps to your relief, the shadowy figure you had spotted from the kitchen is nowhere to be seen; you even checked behind the couches to be sure. The fact that there’s an intruder in your house, whose exact whereabouts are unknown, causes you no small amount of anxiety. There’s the stairs to the upper floor, where your bedroom would be. Do you go up there? Or maybe you can open the basement door and see what’s down there.
