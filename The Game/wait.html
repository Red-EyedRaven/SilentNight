<p>You haven’t quite made up your decision yet, so you just stand around for a little while, hands in your pockets and humming a tune you can’t even hear. </p>
<p>
    The temperature is rather pleasant, and the wind is delicately dragging its fingers through the grass and treetops. The moon is quite beautiful tonight, but you have no way of knowing, for the gray clouds obscure its luminescent visage. It’s strange how peaceful the atmosphere of the night is, considering the fact that your residence was just the scene of a break-in.
</p>
<p>
    You’ve spaced out for quite some time now. Are you finally ready to do something?
