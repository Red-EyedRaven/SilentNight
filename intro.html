<p>You’re coming home from work as a professional cat video maker. You are deaf.
You discover your window smashed in. Someone broke into your house. It is a serial killer.
You go inside the house so you can contact the police with your teleprinter. 
However, the intruder is still there and you don’t know that.
You can enter from the back or the front
