<p>You decide to head through the back. Thankfully, youâ€™re a clumsy fool who forgot to lock your back door. Slipping quietly through the door, you enter the kitchen. From the kitchen, you can walk to the room of living. But as you gaze through the open doorway, into the living room, you notice some shadows shifting, as if it were a specter shrouding itself. There is the intruder! Thankfully, they seem to not have notice that they have been noticed. Taking a quick look around, you notice that everything seems to be in its place. Except over at the knife rack, where one particularly large and threatening knife seems to have suspiciously gone missing. Must be a coincidence.  What will you do now?</p>
